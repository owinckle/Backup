- How -
Go to ?page=recover. There's a hidden input tag in the HTML that
contains an email as value. Change it to yours.

- What is it -
Some websites store data hidden variables, invisible to users unless they
inpect the code and edit it. Let's be real, only someone who barely knows
how to even create a .html file would be dumb enough to do that..

- How to avoid it -
Instead of grabbing the email from the html, you could use PHP instead.
