- How -
In robots.txt we saw a directory named .hidden. There are dozens of directories inside directories with a
README file in eache of them. We can use a crawler to find the flag.
python crawler.py xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx

- What is it -
You can use this to find specific files that the devs tried to hide...

- How to avoid it -
You can protect those files using .htaccess
