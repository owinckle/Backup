- How -
On ?page=media there is an XSS exploit in the url. You can change the src in "src=" and put some scripts in base64,
such as "PHNjcmlwdD5hbGVydCg0Mik7PC9zY3JpcHQ+" which is "<script>alert(42);</script>".

- What is it -
You could use this kind of vulnerability to redirect someone to some malicious website.

- How to avoid it -
Either put the images in a database or html, not in the link.
