- How -
There is a admin login page at /admin.
Using the robots.txt file, we can see there's a /whatever folder with a htpasswd file in it,
containing a username and a password hashed in md5. Using an online md5 database, we can login as root using "dragon" as password.

- What is it -
We usually use robots.txt files to to decide whether or not we want a page to be indexed,
but some people don't use htaccess to secure files.

- How to avoid it -
Simply use htaccess to protect directories and files
